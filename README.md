## Overview
This project analyzes customer churn (customers leaving the provider) data from SyriaTel, a telecommunications provider, identifying what type of customers were churning and developing a model that could predict if a customer is likely to churn. SyriaTel can use this analysis to focus their efforts in modifying certain cellular plans, especially in key states such as NJ, CA, TX, MD, and SC. In additiona, SyriaTel can use the model can help identify which customers are likely to churn.

## Business Problem
SyriaTel has been facing a customer churn problem. Based on a customer survey data, SyriaTel had a churn rate of ~14%, while the typical churn rate is between [0.5-5%](https://stlpartners.com/research/telco-economics-mobile-churn-rates-and-reduction-strategies/) for other mobile operators. Churn rate is very important because it is typically more expensive to obtain new customers than to retain existing customer. In order for SyriaTel to improve their churn rate, SyriaTel has tasked our team to help them predict which customers are likley to churn and provide actionable recommendations to mitigate churn.
